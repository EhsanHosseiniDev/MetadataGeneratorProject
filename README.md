# Metadata Generator

## Description

**Metadata Generator** is a tool designed to automatically extract and generate metadata from backend components such as controllers, commands, and tables. By using attributes to flag specific parts of the code, it can automatically collect the necessary information to generate dynamic user interfaces, forms, and pages for the front-end. This solution significantly accelerates the development process by reducing manual effort and ensuring that the front-end always stays in sync with the backend data structure.

## Features

- Automatic extraction of metadata from backend components.
- Dynamic generation of user interfaces, forms, and pages.
- Synchronization of front-end and back-end data structures.
- Reduces manual coding effort and speeds up development.
